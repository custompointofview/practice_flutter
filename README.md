> Full disclaimer: I didn't get to the end on all of them, mostly because of lack of time. If there is anyone who considers them relevant for their work, please ping me or open an issue and I'll finish the implementation. Thanks for your understanding.

> This repo could change over time as I add different exercises or snippets
